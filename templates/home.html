        <h4>Hello!</h4>
        <p>I've worked very hard on this website, but there will inevitably be a few bugs (errors), since it is still in beta. If you encounter any, <strong>please</strong> let me know. You can do this by going to the "Feedback" tab and writing me a note. I'll try to fix errors as quickly as possible. Even if there isn't an error, feel free to write a note saying how much you love math and science. Or how much you hate it. I don't judge.</p>

            <h4>Want to know what <em>really</em> happens when you hit the 'submit' button? <small>Intended for computer scientists</small></h4>
            <p>When you have filled out a form and you hit 'submit', two things happen. First, your browser checks (using Javascript) to see that everything you have entered is valid data. Hopefully, you've been good and have been listening to the colored feedback (success, warning, or error) that pops up when you blur away from an input element. In case you have been bad, the browser will tell you to edit your input. Once the browser is happy, it sends your data to a server, which is currently hosted on heroku.com, but at some point may be on the menloschool domain. Server-side scripts are written in Python, so when the server recieves a form, it wraps the data in a Requests object that contains information you entered (like your name, the classes you need help in, etc.) as well as meta-information (Request objects have a unique ID, a timestamp that keeps track of when you submitted a request, and more). These requests objects are stored on the server using cPickle, a python module that for all intents and purposes writes data structures to text files. Requests are stored in Python's native list class, which you can think of like Java's ArrayList or Queue. At some point, requests will be stored in SQL databases, but today is <em>not that day!</em>. When the browser asks the server to show information about stored requests, the server unpickles our stored data and (through the power of Jinja2 templating!) returns HTML containing the guts of each request. If you're interested in more, either talk to me on the quad, or check out the GitHub page to see the code itself.</p>
